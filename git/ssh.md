To set global user settings for Git, you need to configure your username and email address, which will be associated with your commits. Hereâ€™s how you can set these global configurations:

## Steps to Set Global Git User Settings:

#### 1. **Open Git Bash** or any terminal on your system.

#### 2. Use the following commands to set your username and email globally. Replace `"Your Name"` and `"youremail@example.com"` with your actual details:

- Set global username:

  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  ```

- Set global email:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
  ```

#### 3. You can check if the settings have been applied correctly by running:

```bash
git config --global --list
```

This command will display the global configurations, including your username and email.

Of course! Here's a **summary note** for your reference on troubleshooting and setting up SSH keys for GitHub:

## **Summary: SSH Key Setup and Troubleshooting for GitHub**

#### 1. **Generate an SSH Key (if not already generated):**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

- Press **Enter** to save the key in the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
- Optionally, set a passphrase for added security.

#### **Add SSH Key to SSH Agent:**

- Start the SSH agent:
  ```bash
  eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
  ```
- Add your SSH private key to the agent:
  ```bash
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```

#### **Add SSH Key to GitHub:**

- Copy your public SSH key:
  ```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```
- Go to **GitHub** > **Settings** > **SSH and GPG keys** > **New SSH key**.
- Paste the copied key and save.

#### **Configure SSH for GitHub (for multiple git account):**

- Edit `~/.ssh/config` (create if it doesn't exist):
  ```bash
  Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```

#### **Test the SSH Connection:**

- Run the following command to test:
  ```bash
  ssh -T git@github.com
  ```
- Expected output (if successful):
  ```bash
  Hi your-username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
  ```

#### **Cloning a GitHub Repository Using SSH:**

- Use the correct SSH URL format:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:your-username/repository.git
  ```

#### **Verbose SSH Debugging (If Needed):**

- For troubleshooting SSH connection issues, use the verbose flag:
  ```bash
  ssh -vT git@github.com
  ```
