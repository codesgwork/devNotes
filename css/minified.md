The code you've shared is a **minified** version of Normalize.css v8.0.1. Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters from the source code (like spaces, new lines, and comments) to reduce its file size and improve website performance. This is done to make the file smaller, which helps in faster loading times on websites.

Here's why the code is written like this:

### 1. **Minification for Performance**  
- **File Size Reduction**: By removing spaces, line breaks, and extra characters, the file size is significantly reduced. This helps decrease page load times, especially for users with slower internet connections.
  
- **Quicker Parsing by Browsers**: Since the file is smaller, browsers can download and parse it more quickly.

### 2. **Consistency Across Browsers (Normalize.css Purpose)**  
Normalize.css is not a reset stylesheet but a CSS library that **makes browsers render all elements more consistently** and in line with modern standards. Different browsers have their own default styles for elements like headings, forms, tables, etc. Normalize.css removes the inconsistencies by providing styles that work across multiple browsers, ensuring uniformity. For instance:
   - `html{line-height:1.15;}` ensures consistent line-height across browsers.
   - `button,input{font-family:inherit;}` forces buttons and inputs to inherit the parent font family instead of using the browser default.

### 3. **Inline Comments**
The comment `/*! normalize.css v8.0.1 | MIT License | github.com/necolas/normalize.css */` at the beginning is not removed during minification because of the `/*!` syntax. This ensures the licensing information stays intact even in the minified version, which is required by the MIT License under which Normalize.css is distributed.

### 4. **Source Map Reference**
The comment `/*# sourceMappingURL=normalize.min.css.map */` references a **source map**, which allows developers to debug the original unminified code while using the minified version in production. Source maps are useful for development and debugging.

### 5. **Purpose of Specific Rules**
The Normalize.css file includes a variety of rules to correct browser inconsistencies, such as:
   - `a{background-color:transparent}` ensures links donâ€™t have a background color in certain browsers.
   - `abbr[title]{border-bottom:none}` removes default styles applied to abbreviations with tooltips.
   - `textarea{overflow:auto}` ensures that textareas behave consistently across different browsers.

### Summary
- **Minified for efficiency**: Reduces file size and improves performance.
- **Normalize.css purpose**: Provides cross-browser consistency for default styles.
- **Source map comment**: Allows developers to map back to the original unminified source for debugging.

This code is ready for use in production environments where performance and browser consistency are important, but developers will typically work with the non-minified version during development.


To make **minified** code more readable by converting it back to a "normal" format (with proper indentation, line breaks, and spaces), you can **"prettify"** or **"beautify"** the code. Here are several methods you can use to make minified code easier to read:

### 1. **Online Beautifier Tools**
There are many online tools where you can paste the minified code, and they will format it for you:

- [**CSS Beautifier**](https://www.cleancss.com/css-beautify/)
- [**Code Beautify**](https://codebeautify.org/css-beautify-minify)
- [**FreeFormatter**](https://www.freeformatter.com/css-beautifier.html)
  
Just copy the minified CSS code, paste it into one of these tools, and hit "Beautify" or "Format." The tool will format the code and make it readable.

### 2. **Using Browser DevTools**
You can also prettify minified code using browser developer tools (like in Chrome or Firefox):

1. **Open Developer Tools** (`F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` or `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac).
2. Go to the **"Sources"** tab.
3. Find the minified CSS file from the list of files loaded in your page.
4. Click on the curly braces `{}` icon (Prettify/Beautify) at the bottom of the DevTools. This will reformat the code, making it readable.

### 3. **Using Code Editors**
Most modern code editors have built-in or plugin support for code formatting:

- **VS Code**: 
   - Open the minified file in Visual Studio Code.
   - Press `Shift + Alt + F` to format the code.
   
- **Sublime Text**: 
   - Install the **CSSFormat** plugin via Package Control.
   - Use the command `CSSFormat` to format your CSS.

- **WebStorm**: 
   - Open the minified CSS file.
   - Right-click on the code and select **Reformat Code** or use the shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + L` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + L` (Mac).

### 4. **Using Command-Line Tools**
If you prefer using the command line, you can use tools like:

- **Prettier** (a popular code formatter):
   - Install Prettier: `npm install --global prettier`
   - Run Prettier on your minified CSS file: 
     ```bash
     prettier --write your-file.css
     ```

- **CSSO** (CSS Optimizer) also has a beautify option for formatting CSS:
   - Install CSSO: `npm install -g csso-cli`
   - Run CSSO with the `--restructure-off` flag to beautify:
     ```bash
     csso your-minified-file.css --restructure-off --output formatted-file.css
     ```

### Example of Beautifying Code
Let's take a minified code snippet:

```css
body{margin:0;padding:0;background:#fff}h1{font-size:2em;margin:.67em 0}
```

After prettifying it:

```css
body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    background: #fff;
}

h1 {
    font-size: 2em;
    margin: 0.67em 0;
}
```

### Conclusion
Using any of the methods above, you can easily convert minified CSS code back to a readable format for better understanding and editing. Online tools and code editors provide a quick and easy way to achieve this.
